# PHASE 1: FLATIRON X MORINGA SCHOOL INDEPENDET PROJECT
# TUTEMBEE PAMOJA
#### This application, individually selected as an assessment tool for the phase I content, aims to, inline with the push for tourism and conservation efforts in kenya, help higlight and raise awareness on the elegant animal species in the Kenyan tropics while pushing for their conservation.

## Project Idea
Domestic tourism has been on the low in kenya, despite the more than enough attraction sites. With nature in mind, such unique sight offered have to be maintained to prevent extinction of rare species, all while preserving and conserving the attractions for the generations to come.

In a bid to bolster local tourism while promoting interactivity in the wild, I aim to develop a simple application that intergrates previewing, real time viewing and donations to help the cause.

The application will thus consume APIs from the KWS and KFS, to display rare bird, snake, butterfly and tree species in common trails in the Tropical Kakamega Rain Forest.

In such manner, tourists are able to anticipate the views along selected trails, keep in tas with its progression by marking out seen species, all while allowing their philanthropy on the go by making donation for their best species. 

The application that caters for all this is highlighted below.

## Understanding The Interface
 
The web page will provides a simple description of the attraction site, and asks the user to enter their name and preferred startin trail. This is used to load the API that contains data for the given trail, and display it to them. The view allows donation also. Viewed species are deleted and a record kept. At the end of the trail, a new trail is selected and so on. On completion, a summation is provided for the veiwed species and donated amount.

## Program Setup Instruction
This application can be accessed in a variety of ways;
1. By running the [live link]() here or in the solution keyword.
1. If you feel a bit enthusiastic, feel welcome and go ahead to;
    * [Clone/fork this repo](https://github.com/TheEmerald001/) to your local machine.
    * Fire the server from within the directory to access the JSON object.
    * play with the code as you may deem fit, allowing flexibility and new objects.
    * have fun!

## Technologies Used
* This app revolves around algorithmic problem solving by applying logic, control flows, data structures, arithmetic expressions and logical analysis to accept, manipulate and return data. This is written in Javascript.
* Backend data storage and authentication is done using a local server, and thus it's consumption as an enthusiat reequires a good understanding of mock server client communication.
* A few gimmicks, ofcourse, and more to come!

## Bugs? Future? Limitations?
Yes, some limitation, great to acknowledge. External APIs from KWS and KF are non-functional, hence use of a local storage, but data provided by KWS!
